### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| chat | Chat | Yes | Chat to which the request was sent |
| from | User | Yes | User that sent the join request |
| user_chat_id | Integer | Yes | Identifier of a private chat with the user who sent the join request. This number may have more than 32 significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this identifier. The bot can use this identifier for 5 minutes to send messages until the join request is processed, assuming no other administrator contacted the user. |
| date | Integer | Yes | Date the request was sent in Unix time |
| bio | String | Optional | Optional. Bio of the user. |
| invite_link | ChatInviteLink | Optional | Optional. Chat invite link that was used by the user to send the join request |
