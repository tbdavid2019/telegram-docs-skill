# Method: copyMessage

**Category**: Available methods

**Description**: Use this method to copy messages of any kind. Service messages, paid media messages, giveaway messages, giveaway winners messages, and invoice messages can't be copied. A quiz poll can be copied only if the value of the field correct_option_id is known to the bot. The method is analogous to the method forwardMessage, but the copied message doesn't have a link to the original message. Returns the MessageId of the sent message on success.
