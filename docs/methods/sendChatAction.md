# Method: sendChatAction

**Category**: Available methods

**Description**: Use this method when you need to tell the user that something is happening on the bot's side. The status is set for 5 seconds or less (when a message arrives from your bot, Telegram clients clear its typing status). Returns True on success.
We only recommend using this method when a response from the bot will take a noticeable amount of time to arrive.
