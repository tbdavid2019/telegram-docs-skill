### Parameters

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| chat_id | Integer or String | Yes | Unique identifier for the target chat or username of the target channel (in the format @channelusername) |
| message_id | Integer | Yes | Identifier of the target message. If the message belongs to a media group, the reaction is set to the first non-deleted message in the group instead. |

| is_big | Boolean | Optional | Pass True to set the reaction with a big animation |
